# How to install the environement needed for the tutorial:

## Tools used in the tutorial:
* NumPy,SciPy: package for scientific computing with Python
* iPython: an interactive shell, we'll be working inside of a web interface called Jupyter (or IPython) Notebooks
* Matplotlib: usefull ploting library

## Installation of the environement 

### *Option 1* (recommended): run the evironement from the virtual box
1. Download and install the virtual box needed for your operating system: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
2. Download the environement OVA from this link 
3. Import it in the virtual box (File>Import)
4. Start the virtual box (in case needed, the password is `stat`)

## Testing the environement:
1. in a clean directory, download the [test notebook](https://github.com/HuguesBrun/statTutorialBND/blob/master/InstallTest.ipynb)
2. start the jupyter notebook and check that the code in the test notebook can be executed properly
