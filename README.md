# How to install the environement needed for the tutorial:

## Tools used in the tutorial:
* `NumPy`,`SciPy`: package for scientific computing with Python
* `iPython`: an interactive shell, we'll be working inside of a web interface called Jupyter (or IPython) Notebooks
* `Matplotlib`: usefull ploting library

## Installation of the environement 

### *Option 1:* using Anaconda (tested on Linux and MacOS)
1. Download and install on your computer Anaconda from [this site](https://www.continuum.io/downloads): all the needed librairies will be included 

### *Option 2:* run the evironement from the virtual box
1. Download and install the virtual box needed for your operating system: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
2. Download the environement OVA from [this link](http://w3.iihe.ac.be/~pvanlaer/Stats.ova) 
3. Import it in the virtual box (File>Import)
4. Start the virtual box (in case needed, the password is `stat`)
5. In a terminal, run the command `jupyter notebook` : the tree directory should appear in Firefox


## Testing the environement:
1. In a clean directory, download the [test notebook](https://github.com/HuguesBrun/statTutorialBND/blob/master/InstallTest.ipynb)
2. Start the jupyter notebook (with the command `jupyter notebook`), you should see that in your web browser:

3. Click on the notebook InstallTest.ipynb to open it
4. Check that the code in every single cell can be executed
